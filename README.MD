Bad Dog Woodshop

Welcome to our team project page!

Our project includes a single page React application with product images, a modal for custom orders and Stripe payment processing.


Credit: Deep Thoughts async was our foundational code to determine navigation, seeds and folder structure.  We also referenced the final State module to develop our payment system.
